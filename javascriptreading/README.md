# Javascript Reading

#### Chapter 1
#####One thing I knew
While bits being the most fundamental data type, I also know next basic data type to be 'strings', series of bits. Instead of numbers, data is represented by combination of character that has number attached to it based on the Unicode Standard. 
######One thing I didn't know
The reading helped me understand that ther are unary and ternary operations other than boolean operation. Essentially, they are types of computer operations based on different amount of values, considerations. Unary being 1 values (e.g. naming), Boolean being 2 values (e.g. true/false), Ternary being 3 values (e.g. make bolean decision based on a third value). 

#### Chapter 2
#####One thing I knew
From previous lesson, I knew that binding is the association of a name to certain data, values or variables. Initially I thought about it as the idea of schema in the world of psychology. Schema are mental frameworks in our midn that organize information by categorization. But just as the reading described, I later knew that it is more like a tenctacle, attaching and detaching values from the name.  
#####One thing I didn't know
From the example of listing even number from 0 to 12, I learnt how looping control flow could be useful in increasing efficiency. The world 'while' creates a loop and the loop is activated by a boolean operations (e.g. whether or not number is smaller than 12).

#### Chapter 3
#####One thing I knew
Function is a type of binding where you attach a value representing an 'action' to a name. Within that 'action, a statement called 'body' is processed/executed in consideration of zero or more 'parameters'. 
#####One thing I didn't know
There are a lot of new concepts, a.k.a. things I didn't know, in this chapter. Binding and Scope is one thing I can recall more accurately than other concepts. As mentioned, binding is like tenctacles attaching and detaching to values. In that sense, scope is the reach of the tectacles. If the scope is the whole program -- global -- you can refer to the related binding whereever you want. In my mind, I imagine an octopus varying its size, hence its reach, based on the 'scope'. Meanwhile, there is local scope that makes bindings live within the 'block, within the function, they are declared. Functions with local scope act on their own without the need to extract information from the outside (the whole program).
