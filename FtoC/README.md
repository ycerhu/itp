# FtoC in javaScript

learning from the class notes section "Bindings Variables" & "Unary and Binary Operators"

I decided f is a modifiable (by myself) value while c is the result of a equation with the unknown, f. 
This is because it is a F to C converter instead of C to F converter.

There I use 'let' for value of f
And 'const' for value of c

let f = 99;
const c = (f + -32) * 5 / 9;
console.log (c);

Finally, I tested on Sandbox as shown in image attached.
