        <p>I have 10 fingers. 10 toes. But they are not enough for me to count the years I have been stuck at this website. 'Help' This is the message I want to bring out through my music.</p>

    <h2>Ezra Bennett - Guitar</h2>
    <section class="container">
        <p>When I was a wee little boy, I would look up to the greatest guitarists, and wish upon a star that I would be like that them one day. But one day, I was just cruising on the internet until I was randomly sucked into my computer. I was a little scared I'm ngl, but I'm from Memphis so I was aight. Anyways I found my gang of hyperpop buddies, and we went on to revolutionize music as a whole</p>

        <p>have you ever wondered what it's like to swallow the entire visible light spectrum within the same frame? you will never begin to parse the ideals of clouds, you will never begin to imagine how drawn out everything is. don't try. don't ask. don't muster. Hi</p>

    <h2>Mila - Modular Synthesis</h2>
    <section class="container">
        <p>My head used to be in the clouds, now it's forever in this laptop. I don't remember the last time I heard something other than hyperpop. I don't remember what anything sounds like. So, this is my everything now: KaNdY kRuSh. Hope you like it!</p>
