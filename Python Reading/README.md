# Python Reading

###  "The way of the Program"
##### One thing I knew
I found many similar concepts I've learnt and heard from our previous curriculum. In particularly, I knew that among programming languages, there are high-level languages and low-level languages. High level lnaguages are more comprehendable to human and Python is one of them. Low-level languages are more comprehendable to computer such as C. 

##### One thing I did not know
I did not know there are Python 2 and Python 3 as two versions of Python. They are mostly the same but with slight difference in some functions such as printing, integer division, and input functions. Although Python ended in 2020, it's useful to keep in mind the possibiltiy of reading Python 2 code when researching online to avoid syntax error.  


### 3 "Functions"
#### One thing I knew
I knew that function definition only exists meaningful within the function and does not live inside the grand flow of execution. We should think function as a 'detour' in the flow of execution. 

#### One thing I did not know
I did not know about the method of using a stack diagram to keep track of which variables can be sued where. It is such a great organizational tool for me to visualize the flow of execution.


### 5 "Conditionals and recursion"
#### One thing I knew
This chapter provides a great review of the different types of conditions and operators we learnt from our previous classes. One thing I knew and is important to make these works is Booooolean expressions! 

#### One thing I did not know
The 'input' function is a built-in function in Python allows the code to be interactive, return results based on users' keyboard input. 


### 10 "Lists" 
#### One thing I knew
I knew that within a list, elements are assgiend into different indices that START FROM 0, meaning the first element oin the list is the 0th element. 

#### One thing I did not know
I did not know this summary of list operations in Python:

Concatentates list: define a new variable as `list a + list b`

List slices: `listname[index:index]`

Add new values: `listname.append('new element')`

Add antoher list to a list: `listname.extend(another listname)`

Sorting values: `listname.sort()`

Delete an element temporarily: `variable = listname.pop(index) `

Delete an element by index: `del listname[index]`

Delete an element by element name: `listname.remove(element)`
